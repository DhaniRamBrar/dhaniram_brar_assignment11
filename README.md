git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


BUILD A DOCKER IMAGE

docker build -t my-web-app .


RUN A DOCKER CONTAINER
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-web-app


TESTING
We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing our Node.js application. To run tests inside the Docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> npm test


## CI/CD
